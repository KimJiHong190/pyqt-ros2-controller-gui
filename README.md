# ROS2 Robot Controller GUI

This repository contains a custom-built GUI designed for controlling and managing robots using ROS2. The interface simplifies the setup for complex robots and allows users to conduct experiments effortlessly by publishing specific ROS2 topics that can be interpreted by the robot's control code for various manipulations.

## Features
1. The GUI is fully integrated with ROS2 (Humble & Foxy), enabling it to publish topics directly to manage your robot's functions.
2. This repository doesnâ€™t delve into each function within the UI, the code is structured in a way that you can easily modify the controls to suit your own purposes.
3. The GUI provides a straightforward interface for conducting experiments with your robot, whether for research, testing, or development.

## Components
**UI_window.py:** This script creates and manages the graphical user interface (GUI) panel.
**UI_controller.py:** This script accesses each button within the GUI and publishes the corresponding topic messages using ROS2.

## Installation
To install and set up the ROS2 Robot Controller GUI, follow these steps

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ui_ws/src
cd ~/ui_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/KimJiHong190/ros2_controller_gui.git
cd ..
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```
Run the GUI
```bash
ros2 run robot_ui run_ui
```

## Usage
When you run the UI, you can confirm that the following topics are being published. You can click each button to see the format of the topics, and you can easily modify these in **UI_controller.py**. The GUI is designed to be intuitive, but feel free to modify the source code to fit your specific needs.


```bash
/calibration_topic
/log_publisher
/parameter_events
/robot1_control_command
/robot2_control_command
/rosout
/ui_setup_is_joint_activation
/ui_setup_is_robot2_activation
/ui_setup_is_robot_activation
/ui_setup_is_wheel_FL_activation
/ui_setup_is_wheel_FR_activation
/ui_setup_is_wheel_RL_activation
